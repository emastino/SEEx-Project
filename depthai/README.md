# Gen1 DepthAI API Demo Program

This repo contains demo application, which can load different networks, create pipelines, record video, etc.

__Documentation is available at [https://docs.luxonis.com](https://docs.luxonis.com).__

## Python modules (Dependencies)

DepthAI Demo requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and [depthai](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-api). 
To get the versions of these packages you need for the program, use pip: (Make sure pip is upgraded: ` python3 -m pip install -U pip`)
```
python3 install_requirements.py
```

Optional:
For command line autocomplete when pressing TAB, only bash interpreter supported now:
Add to .bashrc:
`echo 'eval "$(register-python-argcomplete depthai_demo.py)"' >> ~/.bashrc`

If you use any other interpreter: https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/

## Examples

`python3 depthai_demo.py` - depth & CNN inference example  

## Conversion of existing trained models into Intel Movidius binary format

OpenVINO toolkit contains components which allow conversion of existing supported trained `Caffe` and `Tensorflow` models into Intel Movidius binary format through the Intermediate Representation (IR) format.

Example of the conversion:
1. First the `model_optimizer` tool will convert the model to IR format:  

       cd <path-to-openvino-folder>/deployment_tools/model_optimizer
       python3 mo.py --model_name ResNet50 --output_dir ResNet50_IR_FP16 --framework tf --data_type FP16 --input_model inference_graph.pb

    - The command will produce the following files in the `ResNet50_IR_FP16` directory:
        - `ResNet50.bin` - weights file;
        - `ResNet50.xml` - execution graph for the network;
        - `ResNet50.mapping` - mapping between layers in original public/custom model and layers within IR.
2. The weights (`.bin`) and graph (`.xml`) files produced above (or from the Intel Model Zoo) will be required for building a blob file,
with the help of the `myriad_compile` tool. When producing blobs, the following constraints must be applied:

       CMX-SLICES = 4 
       SHAVES = 4 
       INPUT-FORMATS = 8 
       OUTPUT-FORMATS = FP16/FP32 (host code for meta frame display should be updated accordingly)

    Example of command execution:

       <path-to-openvino-folder>/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/myriad_compile -m ./ResNet50.xml -o ResNet50.blob -ip U8 -VPU_MYRIAD_PLATFORM VPU_MYRIAD_2480 -VPU_NUMBER_OF_SHAVES 4 -VPU_NUMBER_OF_CMX_SLICES 4

## Reporting issues

We are actively developing the DepthAI framework, and it's crucial for us to know what kind of problems you are facing.  
If you run into a problem, please follow the steps below and email support@luxonis.com: 

1. Run `log_system_information.sh` and share the output from (`log_system_information.txt`).
2. Take a photo of a device you are using (or provide us a device model)
3. Describe the expected results; 
4. Describe the actual running results (what you see after started your script with DepthAI)
5. How you are using the DepthAI python API (code snippet, for example)
6. Console output
