  The `mobilenet-ssd` model is a Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD) network
  intended to perform object detection. This model is implemented using the Caffe\*
  framework. For details about this model, check out the repository <https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD>.

  The model input is a blob that consists of a single image of 1x3x300x300 in
  BGR order, also like the `densenet-121` model. The BGR mean values need to be
  subtracted as follows: [127.5, 127.5, 127.5] before passing the image blob into
  the network. In addition, values must be divided by 0.007843.

  The model output is a typical vector containing the tracked object data, as
  previously described.
